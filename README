XMLServUtil

A small collection of utility classes extracted from the source of XMLServ, an XML/XSL based CMS written in Java.

The two current parts are:
*) An interface class for JDOM Element for automatic type conversion when setting attributes

*) A helper class for dynamically constructing PreparedStatement isntances and setting the values to be used for placeholders in the query. Another version uses named placeholders.

To compile this library the following JARs are needed in directory ../XMLServUtilDep/lib:
*) jdom-1.1.3.jar
*) junit-4.10.jar
*) junit-dep-4.10.jar
